    "The 80-20 split is pedagogically the best split but since we also have to create an additional validation set, it will technically be 80-10-10. This split is being done through train_test_split. It is paramount that if one instance of fake news appears in the training set, it doesn't appear in the validation and test set. This is to ensure that both the validation and test sets are truly \"unseen\" data in comparison to the training set but is still representative of the type of data that will be encountered by the model. The same holds for any data that appears in the validation and test set. The data has to be truly unique in terms of occurrence. Additional check to ensure this will be undertaken in the coming sections."
